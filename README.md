## Introduction

The vision of Book Worm is to create more than just a platform to explore books. It aspires to be a virtual haven for book loversâ€”a place where users can not only discover new reads but also curate and personalize their reading experience.

Book Worm goes beyond conventional book discovery by introducing a unique virtual bookshelf feature. Users can explore books, add them to their personal bookshelves, and seamlessly organize and track their collection. The heart of this feature is the "My Shelf" functionality, allowing users to create and customize virtual bookshelves. Whether it's a collection of books to be read, those currently in progress, or those completed, Book Worm empowers users to tailor their bookshelves based on reading progress and preferences.
